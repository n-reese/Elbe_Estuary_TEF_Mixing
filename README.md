# Elbe_Estuary_TEF_Mixing

***Scripts used for the Master's Thesis by Nina Reese on the Total Exchange Flow and salinity mixing in the Elbe Estuary [1]***

This repository contains the Python scripts used to generate the figures shown in Chapter 6 of the thesis. It loads data from the direct model output produced with the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM, www.getm.eu). The setup of the Elbe Estuary can be requested from the git author.

Routines are based on MacCready (2011) [2], Wang et al. (2017) [3], and Burchard et al. (2021) [4].



*TEF.py: Along-channel study of the Total Exchange Flow (TEF, [2],[3]) in the Elbe estuary.

*Mixing.py: Analysis of the salinity mixing in the Elbe estuary, including along-channel variability and the Universal Law of Estuarine Mixing [4,5]. Additionally plots spring-neap averaged salinity distribution along the thalweg.

Further documentation and commentary can be found in the respective scripts.
